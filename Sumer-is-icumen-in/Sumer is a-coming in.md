###Summer is A-coming In 
Summer is a-coming in, <br/>
Loudly sing, cuckoo! <br/>
And spring forth the wood now.<br/>
Seed grows<br/> 
And mead blooms<br/> 
Sing cuckoo!<br/> 
Ewe bleats after lamb,<br/> 
Cow lows after calf;<br/> 
Bull leaps,<br/> 
Goat farts,<br/> 
Sing merry, cuckoo!<br/> 
Cuckoo! Cuckoo!<br/> 
Well you sing cuckoo:<br/>
Nor stop you ever now.<br/>
*Sing cuckoo, now, sing cuckoo!*<br/>
*Sing cuckoo, now, sing cuckoo!*<br/>
