Adam lay i-bounde,
Bounden in a bond;
Foure thousand wynter
Thoughte he not to longe.
Aand al was for an appel,
An appel that he took,
As clerkes fynden writen
In here book.

Ne hadde the appel take ben,
The appel take en,
Ne hadde nevere oure lady
A ben hevenes quene.
Blessed be the tyme
That appel take was,--
There-fore we mowen synge
"Deo gracias."
