            Four thousand winters <br/>
            He thought not too long;<br/>
            And all was for an apple, <br/>
            An apple that he took,<br/>
            As clerks find written <br/>
            In the Book.<br/><br/>

            Blessed be the day <br/>
            The apple was taken,<br/>
            Therefore we might say, <br/>
            "Deo gracias!!"
