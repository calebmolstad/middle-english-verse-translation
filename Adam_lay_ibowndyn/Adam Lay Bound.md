###Adam Lay Bound
Adam lay bound, <br/>
Bound in a bond,<br/>
Four thousand winters <br/>
He thought not too long;<br/>
And all was for an apple, <br/>
An apple that he took,<br/>
As clerks find written <br/>
In the Book.

Never had the apple taken been, <br/>
The apple taken been,<br/>
Never ever had our lady <br/>
Have been queen of heaven.<br/>
Blessed be the day <br/>
The apple was taken,<br/>
Therefore we might say, <br/>
"Deo gracias!!"<br/>
