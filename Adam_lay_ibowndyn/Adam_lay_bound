Adam lay bound,
Bound in a bond,
Four thousand winters 
He thought not too long;
And all was for an apple, 
An apple that he took,
As clerks find written 
In the Book.

Never had the apple taken been, 
The apple taken been,
Never ever had our lady 
Have been queen of heaven.
Blessed be the day 
The apple was taken,
Therefore we might say, 
"Deo gracias!!"
