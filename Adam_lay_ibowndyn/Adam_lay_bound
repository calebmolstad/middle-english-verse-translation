Adam lay bound,bound in a bond,
Four thousand winters he thought not too long;
And all was for an apple, an apple that he took,
As clerks find written in the Book.

Never had the appel taken been, the apple taken been,
Never ever had our lady have been queen of heaven.
Blessed be the day the apple was taken,
Therefore we might say, "Deo gracias."
